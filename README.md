# PHP-Small-projects
This repository includes small php projects such as covering basics in php and also fun little apps to get knowledge in php.

## Why Learned php ?
It's kinda funny but i learned php for increasing my web development skills and know what it takes to build a website like php and this project contains the all php basics from scratch and also include some small small core-php projects.
And as i was in my 5th Semester of B.Tech(Computer Science and Engineering) I was having my web develoment subject and for that i learned this php.

## Can You Use This :
Yes ofcourse. This is made purely open so that other developers can use this app so that they can learn and include this in their own projects.

## What was purpose ?
There is nothing important for me more than gaining more knowlede and learning new technologies so that i can update myself and other people with what is present in today's scenario. Moreover so that I can guide anyone what to learn and which thing suits them.
